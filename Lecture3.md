## Lecture 3 

### Standard template library (STL). 
> The Standard Template Library, or STL, is a C++ library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators; it provides many of the basic algorithms and data structures of computer science. The STL is a generic library, meaning that its components are heavily parameterized: almost every component in the STL is a template. You should make sure that you understand how templates work in C++ before you use the STL." -SGI Introduction to the Standard Template Library

### Objects and templates 
- Suggested reading: http://www.martinbroadhurst.com/stl/stl_introduction.html 
- The STL provides us with an extension of data types. Arguably one of the most useful libraries when programming in C++. 
- Containers and algorithms
- Iterators
- Concepts and Modelling
- Refinement 

### STL Containers 
- std::vector
- std::list
- std::deque
- std::map and std::multimap
- std::set and std::multiset

### Execution modalities ::bug::
- What is "to debug"? - Why debug? 
- How do I debug my code? (old school vs. current methods)
- What is a debugger and what is it used for?
- *assert*
- Preconditioners (Project settings)
- Debug vs. Release
- Deployment

### Plotting with C++ (Gnuplot). 
- How can I plot a simple graph with C++?

### First Assignment.
